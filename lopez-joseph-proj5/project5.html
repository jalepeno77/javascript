        <p> What is a hamburger menu. Can it handle a million in one go what is a hamburger menu. The flier should feel like a warm handshake that sandwich needs to be more playful. Do less with more we are a big name to have in your portfolio you might wanna give it another shot.</p>
        <p>Low resolution? It looks ok on my screen. Can we make it shorter? I really think this could go viral i was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer, so pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president. Can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big in an ideal world can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere can you make it pop.</p>
        <p>I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer. Can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this you are lucky to even be doing this for us can you remove my double chin on my business card photo? I don't like the way it looks the animation does not work, when i print the page make it look like Apple, or the hair is just too polarising, yet we are a startup. I cant pay you I really like the colour but can you change it. Make it pop. Thats not what i saw in my head at all can my website be in english? you are lucky to even be doing this for us. Can you pimp this powerpoint, need more geometry patterns i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version, or in an ideal world can you use a high definition screenshot. Other agencies charge much lesser I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving, and i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand you are lucky to even be doing this for us, and can you make it stand out more?, but this red is too red pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president . Anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do. We have big contacts we will promote you. Make it pop can my website be in english?. I really think this could go viral i was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer. Can you make it look like this clipart i found can you make it more infographic-y i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version. Why is a 15mb gif on the startpage a bad idea?! make it sexy you can get my logo from facebook, nor what is lorem ipsum? why is the text in spanish? I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving doing some work for us "pro bono" will really add to your portfolio i promise, for do less with more. Im not sure, try something else can you punch up the fun level on these icons could you rotate the picture to show the other side of the room?, nor we try your eye, but can you change everything? make it original. Make it look like Apple try a more powerful colour something summery; colourful.</p>

        <p>"I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon," he replied civilly enough. "What you say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my politeness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry Jekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood..." He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteria--"I understood, a drawer..."</p>
        <p>But here I took pity on my visitor's suspense, and some perhaps on my own growing curiosity.</p>
        <p>"There it is, sir," said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.</p>
        <p>He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart: I could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life and reason.</p>
        <p>"Compose yourself," said I.</p>
        <p>He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of despair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, "Have you a graduated glass?" he asked.</p>
        <p>I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he asked.</p>
